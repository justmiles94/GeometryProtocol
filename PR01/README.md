# GeometryProtocol
Custom web protocol for networking class assigned by Dr. Gamage

The makefile builds and cleans this project creating executables.

The project uses the pthread and math libraries which are linked from the makefile.

A large portion of both source files was copied from beej.us the guide to network programming. Customization was added to fit project specification around his implementation of socket management. My original work goes until the socket starts being setup and again proceedes when  the connection to send and receive data is made.

I personally developed the protocol implementation to project specifications.
